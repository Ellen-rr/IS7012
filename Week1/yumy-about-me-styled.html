        <h3>Why I chose MS-IS?</h3><hr>
        <p>From my undergraduate study at University of Cincinnati, and among all the fascinating learnings, I have two major takeaways that will shape my future life. <b>The first is that I enjoy coding</b>My initial interest was sparked by a course named Application Development with Java, in which I developed the java algorithm for a trivia game. It allows the player to answer preloaded questions by clicking buttons and then reward points will be added or deducted basing on the players responses. Although it is a trivial project but it was the beginning of my fascination of computer coding. 
            <b>The second takeaway is that I enjoy working with corporate clients.</b> Once I did a part-time job at Milk Jar, a local cafe. I found the logo of the shop is rather outdated and some improvement with modern elements could be used to increase its customer popularity. So I took the initiative to propose to the manager and discussed the detail. I used PS and Ai to complete the work in time and the output was satisfactorily accepted by the manager and the customer. I found that helping business needs with customized solution is extremely achievable and motivational for myself. 
            To combine my both passion and my undergraduate studies, I would like to become an enterprise consultant specializing in IT platform, system security management and enterprise planning. To work on a project based position, I will never be bored of my works and kept being challenged to deliver intelligent and suitable solutions to the client. To make this possible, I am endeavored to strengthen up my capabilities by pursing master degree studies. 
            The Master of Science in Information System program offered by University of Cincinnati offers such opportunity for me. It sits under the Lindner College of Business which means that, besides technical trainings, it has a strong focus on business development and considerations, which provides the soft skillsets equally important as technical skillsets for people who wish to work in business consulting industry. The flexible curriculum will also enable me to further my self-discovery by taking courses in different specializations. In addition, the close relationship the program maintains with the industry and its corporate partners are valuable resources for students who look forward to launching their career after graduation. The insightful information shared by corporate representatives are hard to reach without the help of the program.
            It is my sincerely wish, that as a current UC undergraduate, that I can continue to follow distinguished faculty, worked with helpful staffs and study with talented classmates across the world. I am proud that I am a UC bearcat and will carry the pride to achieve further development.
